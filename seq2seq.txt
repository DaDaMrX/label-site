A: ah , i can do it perfectly .

A: most current computer systems simply can't handle it because this model truly has extraordinary capabilities .
B: maybe after the next generation of technology comes out , the price of this model will become more affordable .
A: but by then , the technology will be outdated .
B: true , but our focus has never been affordability anyway . coastwise , we may not be very competitive , but qualitywise , we definitely have an edge .
A: that's right , no one else has a product on the market now that is comparable .
Targ-B: this model has advanced technoledge , superior components , it is compact , and it ' s a top - quality product .
Pred-B: well , the sales of our product features are much higher as we can share with us . but we don ' t think there will be that many

A: well , there are a lot to do , but nothing to worry about . first , make sure they don't go far from the railings .

A: that's a good idea . and remind them to be slow at the beginning , not to run into the railings .
B: ok . anything else ?
A: never go to the center of the lake . the ice there is too thin to skate on .

B: yes , fine . i had something wrong with my stomach . i won ' t go into detail , but it wasn ' t serious .
Targ-A: i really dislike going to a doctor or to a hospital .
Pred-A: i was worried about that . the doctor has examined some medicine that points for materials . he will come back to see us .

A: yes , let's go in .
B: it is a new park , isn't it ?
A: yes , how do you know ?
B: i guessed it .
A: well , generally speaking , the park is a window on the world history , a window on the world civilization and a window on the world's tourist attractions as well .
Targ-B: oh , how wonderful !
Pred-B: so open it and see what they are interested in ?

A: good day ! welcome to lincoln bank , how may we assist you ?

A: here you are .
B: are you keeping the small bag as carry-on luggage , sir ?
A: yes .
B: you must weigh that as well .
A: all right .

Pred-B: your luggage is two pounds over , i am afraid there ' ll be an excess luggage charge , sir .

A: i'm really mad at bob .
Targ-B: what for ? ( why ? )
Pred-B: what ' s the problem ?

Targ-B: actually i ' m buying a camera for my husband .
Pred-B: i ' m afraid this one fits you . all these made of paper has been worn down .

A: you can ' t really tell everything about a house from the outside . let ' s go inside .
B: i don ' t think that it is looking any better inside here .
A: i think that fresh paint and cleaning would help it look a little better .
B: it is just too dark in here with so few windows .
A: i hear that the kitchen is quite large . let ' s go check it out .
Targ-B: the kitchen may be large , but it doesn ' t have any storage space .
Pred-B: has the kitchen nor the bathroom included ?

A: hi jim . do you have a minute ?
B: sure , what ' s up ?
A: some of us are going to start a soccer team . would you like to join us ?

A: yeah , you seem to like those styles .
B: sure do . i get a kick out of looking punk .

Targ-B: our silk is known for its good quality . it is one of our trade - trional exports . silk blouses are brightly colored and beau - fully designed . they ' ve met with great favor overseas and are always in great demand .
Pred-B: yes , they are . like this one , too . but i ' ve never been able to see a lot of them on the market . there

Pred-B: ok , on earth ! it ' ll be fun . you have to say you ' re a football player .

A: we should eat more vegetables instead of junk food to stay energetic .
B: and fruits !
A: surely it is . getting enough sleep is also crucial for fitness .
B: i've heard that . does your trainer tell you anything about keeping fit ?
A: yeah , he advises me to stay in a good mood . that can also help one to keep sound physical health .
Targ-B: i think if you follow your trainer ' s advice , you ' ll be on the right track .
Pred-B: so you can also teach me how to play chess , and how to get along with her friends .

A: it's important to do proper exercises .
B: you're right . too much or too little won't do any good .
A: the trainer tells me , besides regular sports activities , i should also have a healthy and balanced diet .
B: sounds reasonable .
A: we should eat more vegetables instead of junk food to stay energetic .
Targ-B: and fruits !
Pred-B: good !

Pred-A: i really wanted to , so i decided to go . i really don ' t have any invitation .

A: really ? tell me about it . i haven't gone to the club for a long time . i am too busy with work .
B: it's important to do proper exercises .
A: you're right . too much or too little won't do any good .
B: the trainer tells me , besides regular sports activities , i should also have a healthy and balanced diet .
A: sounds reasonable .
Targ-B: we should eat more vegetables instead of junk food to stay energetic .
Pred-B: well , this one says you can have an interview , so you can ask the manager to help me .

A: two years or so .
B: that is great . do you have to work the night shift ?
A: no , in most cases i don't have to unless there is something urgent to deal with . i work five days a week .
B: do you enjoy work here ?
A: it is hard to say . but i've to start by working as a trainee before i really become an experienced marketing assistant . sometimes , i am really under great pressure when it gets busy .
Targ-B: take it easy . i ' m sure you will gain enough experience while working as a marketing assistant . i hope you haven ' t been given much trouble in the job .
Pred-B: very good . there is a chinese company that usually takes part time on the weekend . i don ' t have time to do this job . if

Pred-B: so please come to the department of motor vehicles company . my name is paul .

A: did you set your clock forward for daylight savings time ?
B: what ? why do we have to do that ?
A: well , at the start of the spring we usually have more daylight in the mornings and less in the afternoon . this is basically due to our position on the planet and the rotation of the earth . in any case , to take better advantage of the daylight available , we compensate by moving our clocks forward one hour .
B: i see . that ' s convenient ! i never understood things like this , such as gmt . i never know what time zone we are in or when to change my clock !
Targ-A: that just stands for greenwich mean time . here in california , we are in pacific standard time , that is eight time zones west of greenwich . remember when we were in beijing ? well , then we were in china standard time , and that ' s eight time zones east of greenwich !
Pred-A: that just stands for greenwich mean time . here in california , we are in pacific standard time , that is eight time zones west of greenwich . remember

Pred-B: but if he wants to beat webtracker , you know nothing happened to me .

A: hi , gary , what happened ? i was waiting for you at the theater . why didn ' t you meet me there ?
B: i thought we were supposed to meet here .
A: don ' t you know our movie starts at seven ? and we were going to meet at the theater at five to seven . then it doesn ' t make sense to meet at the apartment .
B: i ' m sorry . we must have misunderstood each other .
A: why don ' t you try to be clearer about your intentions ?

A: no . i don't buy it regularly enough for it to be worthwhile .
Targ-B: how much does the magadize cost ?
Pred-B: why don ' t you just get the report ready ?

A: oh , i ' ll go to shanghai to practice there .
B: that ' s a good idea . it must be easy to find a job in shanghai .
A: i think so , you know there is a great deal of opportunity for business there .
B: and english is very useful in your job .
A: i think it will be very useful in many ways . beside , shanghai is an important trade center , not only in china , but also in the world , english is useful in almost all walks of life .
Targ-B: you will be a very promising one .
Pred-B: sure . a chinese daily or international business is easy to take .

A: did you stop at the big waterfall for pictures ?
Targ-B: sure , we wouldn ' t miss it for anything . after that , we took a short cut to the park . there was very little traffic , so we got there in less than an hour .
Pred-B: it is beautiful because in the morning there would be a lot of people . we had a great time .

A: how do you decide what grade we get ?
B: i look at many things , attendance , quizzes , and tests .
Targ-A: what is the most important factor ?
Pred-A: do you think you ' ll be able to make good progress ?

A: have you ever been invited to a chinese feast ?
B: sure . beijingers are distinguished for their warmth and hospitality .
A: as far as you could see , is dining at a chinese table a distinct experience ? to what extent does it differ from that in your homeland ?
B: to begin with , i have to use chopsticks .
A: but you look quite proficient in using them now .
Targ-B: certainly . after all , i ' ve been here for two years . it ' s not much uphill work for a foreigner to get used to chinese dinner utensils . though , i do feel hazy about how to behave appropriately at a ch
Pred-B: while seeing the chinese plates were on the table , they were not quite comfortable , but as you know , i ' ve been sitting there for a

A: he asked me how long it took me to learn english .
B: but , you were born and raised in california !
A: yeah , but i get that sometimes . it doesn't matter how many generations my family has lived in the u . s . , we'll always be foreigners in their eyes .
B: what a racist ! how can you stand working with the guy ?
A: you know , richard isn't such a bad guy . he made the comment out of ignorance , not malice .
Targ-B: so , what did you say when he asked you how long it took you to learn english ?
Pred-B: right . then he ' s on very tall and handsome . what ' s his favorite teacher ?

A: it just depends . if we have important visiting delegations , you have to stay with us . it's not unusual .
B: mr . smith , i's like to ask you a question .
A: ok , please .
B: what specific duties would i perform if i am hired ?
A: nothing different from a secretary's common responsibilities . however , you know , our company is an international trade-oriented company , can you handle english papers and write english correspondence ?
Targ-B: yes . i specialized in english secretary studies at college and that ' s one of the main parts of my present job .
Pred-B: yes , we should be able to answer a question at the moment , sir . how about your present employer ?

A: hello ?
B: hi , mr . smith . this is mary . is jenny there ?
A: no , i ' m afraid not , mary . may i take a message for her ?

Targ-B: i think it ' s a waste of money .
Pred-B: where ' d you get the bus go ?

A: i am not surprised , you eat too much .
B: and i suppose sitting at the desk all day in the office doesn't help .
A: no , i wouldn't think so .
B: i do wish i could lose weight .
A: well , why don't you go on the diet ?
Targ-B: i ' ve tried diets before but they ' ve never worked .

Targ-A: is that really all that you eat ?
Pred-A: what foods are you going to eat ?

A: have you ever been invited to a chinese feast ?
B: sure . beijingers are distinguished for their warmth and hospitality .
Targ-A: as far as you could see , is dining at a chinese table a distinct experience ? to what extent does it differ from that in your homeland ?
Pred-A: as far as you can see , in china , is it a distinct experience that you could visit beijing without visiting any chinese food restaurants in china ?

A: can i help you , sir ?
B: yes , i'd like a book about law .
Targ-A: would you tell me the name of the book and the author ?
Pred-A: ok . what kind of books do you want to be available ?

A: wei ! this is a first-you didn't bargain !
B: bargain ? i'd feel way too guilty .
A: but you could have saved money .
B: from a sweet ma ? ! it's not worth it . plus , i'd happily pay more for these things i bought !
Targ-A: f . y . i . , there is a flea market nearby , but maybe you ' re done . . .

A: ok , wait a minute ... let's see . i'm a taurus , and it says , mars is in the third house , and is soon to eclipse venus . i don't know what that means , but then it says , your charm and drive will win others over to your way of thinking . remember to be positive . sounds good to me .
B: what about gemini ? what's the prediction ?
Targ-A: since mercury has crossed paths with jupiter , your fortunes are falling . bad luck will follow you today , and you will lose that which you value . be careful .
Pred-A: but , it ' s not human beings that anymore . in america , it ' s like a planet , and people don ' t have the same

A: shouldn't we make an appointment first ?
Targ-B: we would , but let ' s just go and see if there ' s an opening now before it gets worse .

A: can i mail it in early next time so it isn ' t late ?
Targ-B: actually , you cannot mail it in early , as it needs to reflect all of the information up to the due date .
Pred-B: it ' s in that case , you ' d better mail it in early because you can ' t know where it is , and in late mail

A: what about abraham lincoln ? did you get any questions about him ?
B: i only had 1 question about him . but you might get more . i dont know if he will have the same exam or not .
A: hopefully he will use the same exam , cause im going to spend most of my time studying the civil war . it is a huge section and that is what he lectured the most on in class .
Targ-B: if you cant study everything , then that is probably the best way to go .
Pred-B: it sounds like he ' s in the class . don ' t worry . it ' s probably a little hard to study . i promise . if

Targ-B: someone suggests that i should go to seattle and hawaii .
Pred-B: do you have any advice on flight ?

A: bill , do you know if the cafeteria around the corner's open today ?
Targ-B: yes . they were open this morning when i came to work . they must ' ve finished remodeling . why do you want to know ?
Pred-B: i don ' t have any choice to get ! just the computer won ' t be comfortable with .

A: i heard that you finished my home inspection , and i was wondering how it went .
B: first of all , we need to understand what i was looking for . do you know what the purpose of an inspection is ?
Targ-A: i am not sure what a home inspection is all about .
Pred-A: the owner said that they would use the same story in your neighborhood , which do you prefer ?

A: ok . do you have anything to declare ?
B: i think there is nothing .
A: any fresh food , live plants , or animals ?
B: oh , no . none of that .
A: thank you . you may lock up your suitcase . here are your passports .
Targ-B: thanks a lot .
Pred-B: are you all right ?

A: do you have a free moment ?

A: good morning . thank you for the interview .
B: no problem . now , do you prefer working with others or flying solo ?
Targ-A: actually , i enjoy both .
Pred-A: like this one .

A: hello . nice to see you again . i heard you went into hospital for a few days to undergo surgery . i hope everything ' s ok .
B: yes , fine . i had something wrong with my stomach . i won ' t go into detail , but it wasn ' t serious .
A: i really dislike going to a doctor or to a hospital .
B: i think most people are a little nervous about it . i was really very , very nervous just before i had the operation , but the anaesthetist gave me an anaesthetic and the next thing i remember was waking up after the operation .
Targ-A: it must have really hurt afterwards .
Pred-A: it seems like the truth . i ' m sure he will understand why you ' re going to face this .

A: what are the most popular sports in your country ?
B: swimming in summer and skating in winter . what ' s your favorite sport ?
Targ-A: jogging and bowling . do you know how to practise bungfu ?
Pred-A: again . it ' s hard to say . perhaps we like watching sports . like playing .

A: now please tell me something about your past work achievements .
B: all right , madam . when i was sales manager at the beijing friendship store . i succeeded in raising the yearly sales volume by 25 % and profit margins from 50 % to 80 % .

A: i thought we were supposed to meet here .
B: don ' t you know our movie starts at seven ? and we were going to meet at the theater at five to seven . then it doesn ' t make sense to meet at the apartment .
A: i ' m sorry . we must have misunderstood each other .
Targ-B: why don ' t you try to be clearer about your intentions ?
Pred-B: why don ' t we try to be clearer about your intentions ?

A: hello , sir , what can i do for you today ?
B: hello , i need a new suit . i have an important interview next week , so i really need to look sharp .
Targ-A: no problem ! we have a broad selection of suits , all tailored made so that it will fit perfectly .

Targ-B: good . i ' ll do it .
Pred-B: i ' ll get started .

A: have you done any work in this field ?
B: yes , after my graduation , i worked in a trade company in macao for one year .
A: what section did you work in ?
B: the export business section .
A: so you must be very familiar with export procedures .
Targ-B: yes , very much .
Pred-B: did you like your work ?

A: are you sure ? i thought i said it was my mother .
B: i don't think so . but it could've been .
A: well . you can trust me this time . my sister is definitely sick . i'm just coming from the hospital . they say she might even die .
B: i don't buy your story . try not to have any more sick relatives this week , all right ?
A: i'll do my best .
Targ-B: just try to be a little more punctual in the future .
Pred-B: alright , then . i ' m leaving tomorrow . thanks for life .

A: i remember my first break up . it was the worst feeling in the world . i was crying everyday for three months . and slowly , it got better . i know you'll feel better too .
B: you've been through this too ?
A: yeah . i remember it very clearly . the pain makes it easy to remember . i know you're really hurting right now , but you know many people experience break ups .
B: but it hurts too much .
A: i know it's painful , but it's only temporary . after the pain goes away , you'll find other girls .
Targ-B: what if i don ' t want to find another girl ?
Pred-B: alright , you ' re right . but i feel worried .

A: what's up ?
B: nothing much , what's going on ?
A: i'm having a party this friday .
Targ-B: oh , really ? that ' s nice .
Pred-B: is that right ?

A: i have some great news ! i was able to switch to the night shift !
Targ-B: i knew everything would work out for you !
Pred-B: really ? what ' s that ?

A: oh , i love him too . he not only sings well but also shows perseverance when he encounters difficulties in the contest .
B: yeah , he got booted after his initial performance in the audition , but he did not give up . he then tried at another two auditions .
A: he had barely survived the third audition and finally got a chance to advance in the contest . fortunately , in the third audition , he has won popularity among the audience . and that's when i started to notice him .
B: me too .
A: before he made the top three , i was so nervous . i just fear that he might be knocked out .
Targ-B: yeah , there ' re so many excellent candidates out there . who knows which one will make it to the final ?
Pred-B: yeah , there ' re so many excellent candidates out there . who knows which one will make it to the final ?

A: that ' s right . you need to create a good image in a limited time , usually about 30 to 45 minutes .
B: it ' s always easier to say something than to do it .
A: it ' s not too difficult to make a good impression . for example , you should take care to appear well-groomed and modestly dressed . avoid the extremes of a too elaborate or too casual style . this will put you on the same level as other applicants and make the interviewer consider more important qualifications .
B: but i love wearing t-shirts and jeans .
A: i advise you not to wear a too casual style when going to an interview . informal clothes as well as torn jeans and dirty shoes convey the impression that you are not serious about the job , or that you may be casual about your work as you are about your clothes .
Targ-B: it ' s a pity that i cannot afford more expensive clothes .
Pred-B: you ' re right . what if i ' m planning on going to a western vacation ?

A: good afternoon ! did you call for a plumber ?
B: yes , yes i did . please come in ! i ' m so glad you came ! this old house is falling apart ! come on into the bathroom . see , here , there ' s water leaking everywhere !
A: i see . let me have a look . it seems that your toilet is clogged , and that ' s why it won ' t flush . let me just get my plunger . no , that ' s not working either . i suspect that there ' s some sort of foreign object in the pipes that â€˜ s causing a blockage . that ' s what ' s making your toilet overflow .
B: oh , that must be because of my four-year-old daughter . she is always flushing things down the toilet . you know how kids are .
A: yeah , i have a little one myself . anyway , these water pipes are really rusty , so they also should be changed . thatcould be causing water to not drain completely , that might lead to more problems in the future . i would also suggest fixing this faucet that isn ' t shutting off properly . i could have it all finished by today if it ' s urgent .
Targ-B: that would be great ! is it expensive ?
Pred-B: good , right .

A: it is the most expensive .
B: well , i don't want it then . can i move to another pump ?
A: yes , i can give you regular unleaded . but you have to back up the car a little .
B: give me regular unleaded then . i will back up . can you wash my windows for me ?
A: i'm sorry , sir . this is not a full service gas station . i will help you fill the gas , but we don't wash windows here .
Targ-B: really ? well , i guess i have to get used to it .
Pred-B: ok , that ' s a good idea .

A: certainly sir . could i have your arrival and departure dates ?
B: we will be arriving on tuesday next week and staying for two days .
A: we have a double room for you with a nice view of the park . would that be ok ?
B: yes , that would be great . how much is the room ?
A: it is ninety-five pounds per night . it is a double room with a bathroom . there is a fridge , coffee maker and a television in the room .
Targ-B: does the bathroom have a bath or a shower ?
Pred-B: that is ok . when will you be leaving ?

A: could you please help me to check out the book ?
B: sure , what's the author's name , please .
A: i can't remember that clearly . it probably be charles ...
B: charles dickens ?
A: no , no , no . i'm not interested in literature .
Targ-B: ok , do you know the title of the book ?
Pred-B: thank you very much . i ' ll be looking for it . why don ' t you read it in the library ?

A: let's have some lunch , do you know of a great restaurant somewhere ?
B: yes , i'm hungry . what types of food sound good ?
A: maybe just a quick sandwich , salad , or something .
Targ-B: i have a great idea of where you might like to go .
Pred-B: ok , then please bring me your order . that ' s on the way to the restaurant .

A: you've heard of bruce jenner , haven't you ?
B: he won the decathlon in the 1976 olympics , right ?
Targ-A: i read that he trained so much that he used to dream about jumping hurdles .
Pred-A: yes . he won the men ' s 100 / 400 double in olympic history !

A: jane , i was wondering if you you had any plans for saturday afternoon .
B: a friend and i are planing to go out , why ? what's up ?
A: there is a special exhibition of french sculptures at the museum , i was hoping you ' d like to come with me .
Targ-B: i am afraid i can ' t i am going to be out all day .
Pred-B: i am afraid i can ' t i have time to go to the museum . it ' s on the day you think i could go there .

A: yesterday i had a quarrel with my roommate . i'm really fed up with all this .
B: tell me what seems to be the problem .
A: my roommate always brings a lot of friends from off-campus . they stay in the room until midnight , singing and talking , drinking and playing cards while i have no place for study . i even don't have the quietness to sleep .
Targ-B: did you ever talk to him about it ?
Pred-B: well , life might have some time to get away from work .

B: absolutely . that's the most important thing to take into consideration . i'm not too worried about the size of the flat .
A: neither am i . so a small place is ok , but we'll get a bigger one if it's not expensive . do you mind if it's in a noisy area ?
B: i don't mind . i'm not a light sleeper , but quieter is better for when we have to study at home .
A: good point . ok , let's go to the estate agent and see what they can offer us .
Targ-B: yes , if we ' re lucky we ' ll find something in the next few days . i think you had a good idea to start flat hunting early .

Pred-B: that ' s out of the question .

A: i would have liked them to be there , but they couldn ' t afford to fly out to see us , and we couldn't afford to fly out to see them , so they understood .
B: did your husband's family get to meet your family ?
A: my husband's parents flew out to meet my family when we got married in my hometown , so that was great . some people spend ridiculous amounts of money on extravagant wedding receptions , but we agreed t
B: that makes sense . did you go on a honeymoon ?
A: we waited until our one-year anniversary to go on our honeymoon to africa .

Pred-B: aside from yourself , who are the other members of the band ?

A: hello ! tomorrow i'm going to need a wake-up call .
B: not a problem . what time shall we call you ?

A: i don't want anything except a taxi , thank you .
Targ-B: i understand . and where will you be going ?
Pred-B: perhaps you ' d prefer a limousine . the limo will be on that day .

A: neither am i . so a small place is ok , but we'll get a bigger one if it's not expensive . do you mind if it's in a noisy area ?
B: i don't mind . i'm not a light sleeper , but quieter is better for when we have to study at home .
A: good point . ok , let's go to the estate agent and see what they can offer us .
B: yes , if we're lucky we'll find something in the next few days . i think you had a good idea to start flat hunting early .
A: how much do you think the rent will be ?
Targ-B: i asked a few people who are already living in places near the university and they said it would cost about one hundred pounds a month .
Pred-B: well , let ' s do it by then . if you want to sign a contract , it should be enough to cover a month in advance .

A: oh , madam , buy what ?
B: a new car . and i've got a small family , two children , and i haven't got a lot of money and ...
A: oh , oh , madam , madam , i'm afraid you have the wrong number .

A: there was plenty of room for me to pull out . you didn't have to stay in the lane you were in .
B: hey , listen . i had every right to stay in the lane i was in . you were supposed to wait until i passed to pull out . and anyhow , you didn't give me any time to change lanes . all of a sudden--bang--there you are right in front of me .

Targ-B: you don ' t need to introduce yourself , yang . you ' re famous .
Pred-B: nice to meet you , too . my name is helen . it ' s nice to meet you .

A: i want to travel .
B: where would you like to go ?
A: the seaside .
B: that's really a good idea . taking a walk on the beach and lying in the sun are pretty good . i recommend you qingdao or dalian .
A: i ' ve been to qingdao before , so i ' ll choose dalian . i've heard that the environment there is very good .
Targ-B: yes , that ' s a good place to spend a holiday . last year i went there . it ' s really .
Pred-B: i suppose you ' ll have a good time .

A: what's your proposal ?
B: your unit price is 100 dollars higher than we want . well , i suggest we meet each other halfway .
A: do you mean a further reduction of 50 dollars in our price ? that's impossible !
B: what would you suggest ?
A: the best we can do is another 30 dollars off . that's definitely the lowest we can go .
Targ-B: that still leaves a gap of 20 dollars . let ' s meet each other half - away again and split the difference , i think this is a price we can both be satisfied with .
Pred-B: now that i think of putting 500 pieces there , we ' ve gotten another offer to make . let ' s meet at the moment . if you

A: hi , i'm george . i'll be your waiter this evening . are you ready to order or do you need a few more minutes ?
B: i'm ready now . i'd like the roast chicken and a side order of corn .
A: and would you like an appetizer before your meal ? the soup of the day is our delicious tomato soup .
Targ-B: i ' ll pass on the soup , but i ' d like a garden salad .
Pred-B: it ' s ok , sir . would you like to order some dessert ?

A: i hear you are expecting your family .
Targ-B: yes , my parents , and soon my brother as well .
Pred-B: so you describe your family , and in writing .

A: i am sorry to trouble you again , mr . stone .
B: it's ok . what do you want to ask ?
A: where should i go after i arrived at the university ?
B: the first place you should go is the international center .
Targ-A: why ?
Pred-A: then how many people are there ?

A: i'm dreadfully sorry for you .
B: thank you very much for your kindness .
A: is there any clue ?
Targ-B: no , he left nothing .
Pred-B: what ' s the matter ?

A: how silly of you to jump out of the window !
B: but that was the first thing that came into my mind when i heard the shout earthquake !
Targ-A: why not use staircases ? the terror was not so violent at that time .
Pred-A: it ' s the worst part is the emergency room ! sit down and fill them in the bathroom .

A: is there anything else , apart from the credit rating and debt to asset ratio ?
B: there is the balance of net liabilities . this must not exceed its net assets and no business loss can be shown during the past two years .
A: right , ok . that , again , shouldn't be a problem .
B: and the total ratio of return on assets should not be lower than the average , for that particular industry , for the first two quarters of the year .
A: well , as far as i can tell , we qualify .
Targ-B: of course we will need proof , originals and duplicate of everything . as soon as you bring in the proof and we assess it , it should be very quick indeed .
Pred-B: yes , it ' s true that you are a saver ' s credit . of course , it ' s also a penalty for having a credit

A: hello , 332440 .
B: oh hello , sally . this is dave thomson here . could i speak to jim please ?
A: i'm afraid he's not in at the moment dave . he went out about an hour ago and he's not back yet .
Targ-B: any idea when he might be back ?
Pred-B: can i leave a message ?

A: what's wrong with you , young man ?
B: doctor , i have a bad cough and a headache .
A: do you have a fever ?
Targ-B: i don ' t know , but i feel terrible .
Pred-B: i don ' t know , but listen .

A: i'm not sure . i know i should know that , but i can't remember right now .
B: well , they're for your wife , so i think you should give her roses .
A: roses will be fine .
B: what color ?
A: i think red would be nice .
Targ-B: do you want to pick them up or should we deliver them ?
Pred-B: oh , how long will it take to get red roses ?

A: all our bathrooms have full size baths with a shower attachment .
B: does the room have an internet connection ?
A: yes , all our rooms have complimentary wireless internet .
B: excellent . do you serve breakfast in the hotel ?
A: yes , breakfast is included in the price . our guests have the choice of a full english breakfast or a continental breakfast .
Targ-B: that ' s great . can i book the room ?
Pred-B: yes , i think you will take the bedroom to also take care of the guests .

A: what time is it anyway ?
B: nine-thirty .
A: oh , my god , three hours already ! i have to get the chores done !
B: no time . that's their headlights in the window !
A: ok , emergency measures . let's throw the dishes in the trash ! two birds with one stone ...
Targ-B: little dude , your life is over !
Pred-B: and don ' t worry . you ' re still going to drive like you ' re still going to hospital .

A: oh , i'm fine .
B: so , are you going to go to class tonight ?
A: maybe ... but i don't think so .
B: really ? what's the matter ?
A: i don't know . i'm just feeling a little sad .
Targ-B: listen . come with me to class , and after class we can go out for dinner .
Pred-B: oh , i don ' t want to go to the class , either . but i ' m too scared . what if i have to do everything

A: so how did i do on my driving test ?
B: do you want the truth ?
A: of course , i do .
Targ-B: well , you really didn ' t do all that well .
Pred-B: did you get your driving test ?

A: good afternoon . i've brought the extra blanket you asked for .
B: oh , thank you .
Targ-A: is there anything i can do for you now ?
Pred-A: would you like some soup ?

A: hi jim . do you have a minute ?
B: sure , what ' s up ?
A: some of us are going to start a soccer team . would you like to join us ?
Targ-B: i don ' t know anything about it . soccer isn ' t as popular in my country as it is here .
Pred-B: it ' s just that i ' m afraid it ' s going to be a good match . have you ever seen a team ?

A: i don't think you did , you know . my neighbor told me she saw some here only yesterday .
B: well , it's all new stock in the window now .
A: may i just have a look , to see if there is anything else ?
B: eh , well , madam , as you know we are closing .
A: yes , yes , i am sorry i won't keep you . it must get on your nerves when customers come in right at closing time . but they were such beautiful saucepans . i ' d have bought them if i had made up my mind on the spot .
Targ-B: perhaps madam , if you come back tomorrow , i could show you the whole range of kitchen ware . and there are still one or two things at the sale price .
Pred-B: no , you don ' t mind walking . it ' s better to use the light . i usually do the work . come on , let '

A: how are you wedding plans going ?
B: very well . we started organizing everything early to avoid a last minute rush to get things done . the only thing that isn ' t ready yet is my wedding dress .
A: when will that be ready ?
B: the dressmakers said that is would be ready in two weeks .
A: you ' re getting married in three weeks . so that should be ok . so , you ' ve prepared the church , catering , transport , hotel-everything .
Targ-B: yes . we ' ve taken care of all of that . we decided not to get married in a church though . neither of us is very religious .
Pred-B: then , when you ' re going to be on a honeymoon to hawaii ?

A: what subjects are you studying ?
B: english , math , commercial and legal studies , and accountancy .
A: have you had any working experience .
B: well , i worked at a supermarket during last summer holidays .
A: what do you like to do in your spare time ?
Targ-B: i like sports very much . besides that , i also like working on a computer in my spare time .
Pred-B: it sounds like you have a very good driver . what about your salary ?

A: did you watch the volleyball match last night ?
B: yeah .
Targ-A: who won ?
Pred-A: for what ?

A: hmm . i have the same problem . when i leave work , it ' s always rush hour . so the buses are always crowded .
B: oh , yeah , it ' s terrible . i will tell you the funniest thing i have seen in china . it ' s when so many people try to get onto one city bus , and the last guy is squeezed in so tight that the door is tightly pressed against his butt .
A: that sounds terrible the way you describe it . but you know , not long ago i really suffered on the bus .
B: what happened ? were you having a hard time getting on a bus ?
A: you just can ' t imagine ! i waited for the first bus but it was too full , so i waited for the second , and it was still very crowded . then i decided not to wait for the next one , and got on the second bus . it was so full that i had to stand on one foot ! no kidding !
Targ-B: hmm . good exercise , uh ?
Pred-B: hmm . good exercise , uh ?

A: why not come over to work in my company ?
B: i need to think it over .
Targ-A: tell me what you need .
Pred-A: when will you come to work ?

A: no , but my little brother likes it very much .
B: it's really a good book . you will like it too .
A: i'll try to read it . actually , i like literature very much .
B: wow , that sounds like a scholar . by the way , who's your favorite writer ?
A: jane austen .
Targ-B: me too . pride and prejudice is my favorite .
Pred-B: why not ? i thought he ' s the most popular guy .

A: i do want to meet with you and take a look at your catalogue . we ' re redecorating and are going to add some things .
B: well , i ' ll be glad to help you out . i can come out anytime on tuesday or thursday of next week .
A: let ' s put it down for 1:15 on thursday . we ' ll definitely need some new filing cabinets and at least one desk unit .
Targ-B: fine . i ' ll bring both our office furniture and equipment catalogues on thursday .
Pred-B: fine , i ' ll bring both our office furniture and equipment catalogs that would be brought to you by friday .

A: shall we share a taxi ?
B: where are you heading now ?
A: i want to go back to my college on the huanghe road . it is very close to your house .
Targ-B: is that the university next to the teachers ' college ?
Pred-B: why you are staying at the university ?

A: what do you think we need to do to get our new branch office running well ?
B: first , i'd make sure that we have a good , local , corporate lawyer . he or she will know all the local laws and regulations .
A: that ' s very important . a friend recommended a good law firm to me . we ' ll need someone to hire staff .
Targ-B: i think that we should send one of our hr people to do that . i don ' t think we should use an agency , because they won ' t be familiar with the type of people we employ . have we decide on the location of
Pred-B: we have one . on our own that is the hr department . i think the department should be more efficient than that of boss . he is one

A: good morning , sir . may i see your passport ?
B: yes , of course . here it is .
A: thank you . are all these yours ?
Targ-B: no , some of them are my friend ' s . do you want her passport , too ?
Pred-B: yes , they are just sent by air tickets , passport or documents .

A: you seem to very busy these days . what are you doing ?
Targ-B: i am swapped with work after 10 - day holiday .
Pred-B: would you like to go for a drink ?

A: next , please . may i help you , sir ?
B: hello , yes , i ' d like to open a bank account .
A: certainly , i can can help you with that . what type of account would you like to open ? a chequing or a savings account ?
B: what what features do they offer ?
A: well , if you just take a look here , see , with our chequing account , you can have unlimited daily transactions for a small monthly fee , and our savings account has a higher interest rate , but you must carry a minimum balance of $ 10,000 dollars .
Targ-B: i see , well , i think i ' m more interested in a chequing account . i like to have easy access to my money .
Pred-B: an accountancy do you think they require ? well , then , if you have more options , you can get one .

A: yeah , but i'm still waiting for my invitation .
B: oh really ? she gave me mine earlier today .
A: well , she'll probably just give me my invitation later on today .
B: yeah , so are you planning on going ?
A: i think so . it sounds like it's going to be a lot of fun .
Targ-B: it really does , i can ' t wait .
Pred-B: i know , and it ' s going to be fun .

A: excuse me , sir . is there a barber near here ?
Targ-B: yes , the nearest one is at the third cross of this road .
Pred-B: it ' s just a block away , and turn left at the traffic lights .

A: that's too bad . how much is a new one ?
B: it's not too much , only about $ 85 .
A: plus installation ?
B: no , my hard drive is easy to remove and replace .
A: really ?
Targ-B: yes , it ' s just a couple of screws .
Pred-B: all right . i ' ll take it .

A: please help yourself to whatever you like , don't be shy .
B: yes , thank you . i've already been helping myself .
A: this dish taste terrific . would you like to try a little ? it is a little hot , but very good .
B: i like hot food , especially sichuan cuisine .
A: would you like another beer ?
Targ-B: i ' ll have another cup of beer insist . i know i don ' t like to drink alone , especially there are someone sitting there next to me .
Pred-B: next time i ' ll try some sichuan cuisine . one of my friends says this one is supposed to be try sichuan . it is a spicy salad

A: you received a letter in the mail .
Targ-B: give it here .
Pred-B: let me see it .

A: why don't you wear a scarf ?
B: what can wearing one do for me ?
A: you're cold because the wind is blowing into your open collar . it's not because your jacket isn't thick enough .
B: so wearing a scarf helps your body to stay warm inside your jacket .
A: yes . that's the secret to wearing a thin jacket .
Targ-B: you know , sometimes i can ' t feel my ears and fingers .
Pred-B: then i will buy some tie for you . in fact , it will probably be fun on the beach .

A: does that suggest diners avoid speaking much ? the same is true in the west .
B: no , absolutely not ! on the contrary , you'll be considered a well-connected , sociable man , if you keep involved in the conversation all the time . but always pay attention to what you say . if the table has a senior guest , say something as upbeat and cheerful as possible . or maybe , you may give the floor to him and keep listening as if very interested .
A: you mean , keeping a low profile in the presence of the old ? that goes in like with confucius ' preachings , right ?
B: correct . show respect for the older people . conventionally , before the meal starts , the younger members are supposed to address each one of the elderly members of the table one by one . others are kept in waiting until the most venerable guest proclaim the beginning of the meal and takes the first bite . toasts also go to these men first before people can toast to each other .
A: any other rules to observe in order to keep modest ?
Targ-B: yes , plenty of them . don ' t eat fast ! people usually keep their dining pace accorded with others . and all the dishes should not be eaten up completely .
Pred-B: sure . it ' s not that simple . the more i should get overdo it .

A: hey suzie . guess what ? i'm having a baby !
B: really ? that's so great . congratulations .
A: thanks . i'm so excited . we've been trying for 8 months now .
B: that's really exciting . how many months are you pregnant ?
A: three months .
Targ-B: are you going to find out if it is a boy or a girl ?
Pred-B: did you also have to young girl ?

A: how about you and tom ? what time is your wedding ?
Targ-B: don ' t be kidding , ok ?
Pred-B: it ' s at seven o ' clock .

A: is there anything wrong ?
B: i ' m worried about my daughter . she can ' t decide about college .
A: don ' t worry . that ' s just a part of being a teenager .
Targ-B: i don ' t mind that . but she disagrees with me about everything .
Pred-B: you should encourage her to make up her mind by herself . you shouldn ' t affect her decision .

A: do you want me to help you ?
B: please .
A: look . here are the core classes . everyone has to take them .
B: so i don't have to worry about them .
A: you're catching on ! however , there are elective courses like wood shop , metal shop , home economics ...
Targ-B: i ' ll take home economics .
Pred-B: what are the classes different ?

A: how do you get road news ?
B: i've a driver mate in my car !
Targ-A: so you have all the news on broadcast ?
Pred-A: have you started driving a car before ?

A: have you declared your income and are you prepared to pay tax ?
B: not yet . i don't know how to fill out the form . what is the tax-free allowance for supporting a dependent ?
A: i don't really know . why not ask the accountant or the lawyer of the law firm ? they will tell you which is subject or not subject to taxation . he can even help you avoid paying tax legally .
B: if i don't pay my taxes , would the tax officials discover it ?
Targ-A: certainly . no one who evades tax can escape from their detection . they ' ll check your income through computers . you ' d better make a declaration to the tax authorities as soon as possible . if you fail to meet the deadline , you will be fined .
Pred-A: not always . it depends on how you take your money back , but if you are allowed to spend more than one year in the states , you

A: have you seen the new james bond movie ?
Targ-B: oh , yes . you ?
Pred-B: oh , yes . you like it ?

A: hi joe , how are you doing today ?
Targ-B: things are going good today . how have you been doing , mary ?
Pred-B: are you shopping for a new job ? any problem ?

A: can i borrow this magazine from you ? it's really interesting and i can't put it down .
Targ-B: i am sorry , but i can ' t lend it to you now , for i haven ' t finished reading it . if you don ' t mind , i can lend you some back numbers to you .
Pred-B: don ' t worry . you ' ve got to be more careful in internet post - looking . it ' s just like your client ' s intention

A: i would like to take this opportunity to welcome monica to our company and introduce her to her department and colleagues . for all of you , we hired monica because she is a very professional accountant and we are very happy to have her in the finance department . she has lots of working experiences as an accountant and i am sure everybody in the department can benefit from this .

Pred-B: that sounds like a good idea .

A: i have to check out today . i'd like my bill ready by 10 this morning .
B: you can be sure of that , sir .
Targ-A: thank you .
Pred-A: ok . would you like a check ?

A: hit ' em high , hit ' em low . class of ' 93 â€” let's go !
Targ-B: hi there , everyone . we hope you ' re having a good night !
Pred-B: ok . i mean to get on something in the mood for that .

A: unfortunately , according to our regulations i have to confiscate these counterfeit notes .

Pred-B: i ' m sorry to be aware that .

A: yes , i believe there are green teas , black teas and scented teas . any others ?
B: well , have you ever heard of oulong tea and compressed tea ?
A: oh , yeah . oulong tea is good for one's health . isn't it ?
B: you surely know a lot about chinese tea .
A: sure , i like drinking tea at teahouses .
Targ-B: oh , so do i .
Pred-B: do you think it ' s a pleasant experience ?

A: excuse me . how long has it been since the business was founded ?

B: paris is a beautiful city . i have never been there . have you ever been there , ken ?
A: yes , i have . i was there in april .

A: oh , yes . how do you do , miss wang ? sit down , please .
B: thank you .

Targ-B: i majored in public relations .
Pred-B: i was an english major in business .

B: well i think i can afford that apartment . but are pets allowed ?
Targ-A: hmm . . . let me look . yes , it says it ' s a pet - friendly building .
Pred-A: no , that ' s too bad . the rent is worth each month , as long as you understand what the rent is nice .

Pred-B: oh , that roses are really expensive .

A: how do you feel about that restaurant ?
B: it wasn't all that great .
A: what did you dislike the most ?
B: i don't think that they had their act together . they didn't seem well prepared .
A: did you think that the food was any good ?
Targ-B: i wasn ' t all that impressed by the food .
Pred-B: i don ' t like the food , either . how was the food there ?

A: everything is now . i'm kind of sick of it .
B: each ring has 3 small diamonds inside the band .

Pred-A: your boyfriend , huh ?

A: really ? are you sure ? i called before and he was there .
B: yes . i'm sure . you have the wrong number . i have used this number for more than 20 years .
A: that can't be true . i remember the number clearly . is your number 1199886 ?
B: no , it isn't . it's 1199866 . it seems that you have misdialed .

Targ-B: it doesn ' t matter . it happens to everyone .
Pred-B: that ' s what i meant . sorry to have kept you waiting .
